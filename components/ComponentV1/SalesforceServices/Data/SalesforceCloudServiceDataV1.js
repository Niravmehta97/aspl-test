Existing internal data on customers and leads is enriched with additional information from social networks, which reduces research time in business development. Sales employees also benefit from the improved data quality and can thus tailor their measures more specifically to leads and customers. With the Sales Cloud, the efficiency of sales is increased both in the office and in the field - at the same time, all data is stored centrally. The focus of the Sales Cloud is the networking of all people involved in the process and thus the increased transparency and visibility of relevant information. This information provides data-driven decision support at a strategic level.',

Because not all customers are the same. Behind each individual is a multitude of stakeholders, interests and specific business requirements. So basically B2B2C â€“ although that is of course still a simplified formulation. The reality is significantly more complex. With the Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Salesforce tries to transform this complexity into an experience that is as easy as shopping for shoes online. And the best part? The Salesforce Commerce Cloud not only optimizes your own business. Because B2B2C deals are inherently deeply embedded in the value chain of another business model, the Salesforce Commerce Cloud creates value across the entire value chain.',
