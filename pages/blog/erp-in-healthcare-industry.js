                                    <p>Before talking about ERP system in healthcare industry, I just wanted to give some information about ERP. ERP stands for enterprise resource planning, but what does ERP mean? The simplest way to define ERP is to think about all the core processes needed to run a company: finance, manufacturing, HR, supply chain, services, procurement, and others. At its most basic level, ERP integrates these processes into a single system.</p>

                                    <p>Due to All of this benefits ERP is now a Modern day essential.</p>
                                    <p>The business needs of ERP software in the healthcare industry are no different. Healthcare providers around the world are under intense pressure to achieve two goals: high quality care and significant cost reductions. To date, health care facilities are increasingly investing in the development of their ERP systems to improve the availability and quality of patient care. In addition, reducing clinical errors and increasing the productivity of health care providers are key reasons for adopting ERP solutions.</p>
                                    <p>The emergence of more patents and technologies has necessitated the need for hospitals and other health care providers to compile a database of patients with important information for doctors and staff. Physicians and nurses need real-time information on their patient’s diagnostic reports to facilitate communication and make their treatments and treatments more effective. In addition, various hospital departments require automated solutions to integrate their primary services, support services and back office operations. Reducing costs and overwork is one of the main reasons for adopting an ERP solution. Dissemination of information throughout the pharmacy, laboratory system, radiology, imaging and communication system (PACS) and electronic medical records (EMRs) for patients are essential. Patients, on the other hand, gain access to the consolidated information of their medical reports to plan timely appointments and make immediate decisions.</p>
                             
                                    <h4>Some of the main benefits of using ERP solutions are:</h4>
                                    <p><strong>Improved patient care: </strong>ERP software enables healthcare providers to provide patients with remote access to critical information resources and reports. It helps patients to be informed about treatment and to make quick decisions. Advanced automated software scheduling simplifies follow-up tests and treatment procedures. The ERP solution ensures the availability of critical patient information across multiple systems.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Reduce maintenance costs: </strong>ERP as part of automated IT software leads to improved process efficiency. ERP offers a wide variety of services such as accounting, finance, human resources and brings them under a single domain. It helps to perform various backup functions such as staff management, account management and asset management.</p>

                                    <p><strong>General health care policies: </strong>This is achieved by integrating basic services such as patient registration, electronic medical records management, radiology department, OPD and emergencies.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Financial Planning: </strong>ERP ensures that payments from various operating care providers are fair, which becomes a win-win situation for providers and payers. It helps maintain health care facilities and benefits in less expensive patient care.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Following best practices: </strong>Health facilities can better manage all policies and procedures related to member benefits, claims, registrations and provider networks, which will eventually be updated with the best industry practices.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Patient Safety: </strong>ERP software gives health care providers the ability to improve safety by making the communication between physicians and patients visible. Many organizations view interactive ERP as an organization’s mandate to provide a culture of patient safety.</p>
