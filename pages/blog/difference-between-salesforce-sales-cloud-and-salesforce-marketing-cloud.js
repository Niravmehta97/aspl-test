                                    <p>Salesforce Sales Cloud and Salesforce Marketing Cloud are two different cloud computing platforms, both developed by Salesforce and each with its unique features. But what exactly does that mean? This article will help you better understand the differences between these two robust sales and marketing tools to choose the one that best fits your needs. Let's start with the meaning of <span><Link href="/blog/what-is-salesforce-sales-cloud-and-how-the-sales-cloud-helps-us"><a target="_blank">what is sales cloud</a></Link></span> and what is marketing cloud.</p>
                                    <h4>What is Salesforce Sales Cloud?</h4>
                                    <p><span><Link href="/service/salesforce/salesforce-sales-cloud/"><a target="_blank">Salesforce Sales Cloud</a></Link></span> was designed to interact with prospective and potential customers via sales forecasting as well as contact and management of opportunities. It is a compelling instrument to track and create revenue throughout the sales cycle, allowing customers to manage their customer relationships efficiently. Sales Cloud primarily focuses on the sales aspects of <span><Link href="/service/crm-software-development/"><a target="_blank">customer relationship management </a></Link></span> (CRM) and how users manage Leads, Contacts, Accounts, and Opportunities instead of providing customer support. Sales Cloud cuts down on time spent on administrative tasks by offering automated features so that Sales teams can concentrate on closing Opportunities!</p>

                                    <h4>What is Salesforce Marketing Cloud</h4>
                                    <p>It is a single marketing platform that can understand consumers, connect with them, and tailor their experience. Marketing automation via email connects customers across any device or channel and integrates customer information and their behavior to send timely, relevant messages.</p>
                                    <p><span><Link href="/service/salesforce/salesforce-marketing-cloud/"><a target="_blank">Marketing Cloud</a></Link></span> offers exciting services suitable for customers who are B2B (when customers are a different business) and B2C companies (when your product/service is direct to the final customer or consumer). The real benefits are the unification of data sources and the ability to customize every channel, as well as the capability to engage with customers at any point in the customer-to-customer relationship and the measurement of the campaign's results.</p>
